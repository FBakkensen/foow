3. **Security Vulnerabilities**
   - Package: `nth-check` (via `svgo/css-select`)
     - Issue: Inefficient Regular Expression Complexity
     - Risk: Build-time only, no runtime impact
     - Tracking: https://github.com/advisories/GHSA-rp65-9cf3-cjxr
   - Package: `postcss` (via `resolve-url-loader`)
     - Issue: PostCSS line return parsing error
     - Risk: Build-time only, no runtime impact
