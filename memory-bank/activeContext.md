# Active Context: foow - Task Management System

## Current Work Focus

1. **Finalizing Development Environment**

   - Testing local development server
   - Installing core dependencies (React Router, Supabase client, state management)
   - Making UI component library decision

2. **Project Structure Setup**

   - Cleaning up default CRA files
   - Establishing folder structure (components, hooks, services, utilities, types)

3. **Initial Backend Configuration**
   - Creating Supabase project
   - Designing database tables
   - Setting up authentication

## Recent Changes

1. **Completed:**

   - GitHub repository created and configured
   - Development branches established
   - Node.js and npm installed
   - Create React App initialized with TypeScript
   - ESLint and Prettier configured

2. **In Progress:**
   - Local development environment testing
   - Dependency installation
   - Supabase project configuration
   - OpenAI API key configuration

## Key Decisions & Considerations

1. **Technical Choices:**

   - Using Context API over Redux for state management
   - Opting for serverless functions instead of full backend
   - Implementing row-level security in Supabase
   - UI component library: Shadcn implemented

2. **ADHD-Specific Adjustments:**
   - Prioritizing single-task view development
   - Focusing on immediate feedback mechanisms
   - Simplifying navigation patterns

## Next Steps

1. **Immediate Priorities:**

   - Complete local development environment setup (test server, install dependencies)
   - Create project folder structure
   - Set up Supabase project and initial tables
   - Configure Netlify project

2. **Upcoming Milestones:**
   - First functional prototype (basic task management)
   - Initial AI integration test
   - First end-to-end user flow

## Blockers & Open Questions

1. **Pending Items:**

   - OpenAI API key configuration
   - Finalizing Supabase schema design
   - Netlify function testing approach

2. **Decisions Needed:**
   - UI component library selection
   - Error handling strategy
   - Loading state designs
