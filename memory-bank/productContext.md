# Product Context: foow - ADHD Task Management System

## Why This Project Exists
1. **ADHD Challenges Addressed**:
   - Task initiation difficulties (overcome through AI decomposition)
   - Overwhelm from complex tasks (managed via subtasks)
   - Distractibility (mitigated through focused interface)
   - Time blindness (helped by deadline tracking)
   - Working memory limitations (supported by persistent task storage)

2. **Key Problems Solved**:
   - Breaks down "stuck" tasks into actionable steps
   - Reduces cognitive load through minimal interface
   - Provides clear visual prioritization
   - Maintains task continuity across devices
   - Supports focus through structured work intervals

## How It Should Work
### Ideal User Experience
1. **Task Creation**:
   - Simple input with optional AI-assisted breakdown
   - Quick addition for spontaneous tasks
   - Clear priority selection

2. **Task Management**:
   - Single-task view to prevent overwhelm
   - Subtask completion with progress feedback
   - Deadline visibility without clutter

3. **Focus Mode**:
   - Clean, distraction-free interface
   - Prominent completion button
   - Gentle transition cues between work/break

### ADHD-Specific Design Principles
1. **Cognitive Considerations**:
   - Minimal steps to start working
   - Reduced decision points
   - Immediate feedback on actions
   - Consistent interaction patterns

2. **Visual Design**:
   - High contrast elements
   - Clear typography hierarchy
   - Limited color palette
   - Purposeful animations (not distracting)

3. **Behavioral Support**:
   - Progress visibility
   - Completion celebrations
   - Gentle reminders
   - Forgiving interaction model

## Target Outcomes
1. **For Users**:
   - Reduced task avoidance
   - Increased task completion
   - Improved time awareness
   - Decreased frustration

2. **For Development**:
   - Validated core concept
   - Clear feedback for iteration
   - Foundation for future features
   - Demonstrated technical viability
